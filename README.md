# Millionaire Quiz App

[Play the Quiz](https://kbc-application.netlify.app/)

The "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" Quiz Application is a dynamic and interactive web-based quiz game developed using the React framework. Inspired by the popular television show, the application provides users with an engaging quiz experience, complete with multiple-choice questions and lifelines.

## Key Features and Technologies Utilized:
  ### 1. React.js: 
    I utilized React.js, a powerful front-end JavaScript library, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allowed for efficient component-based development, resulting in a seamless user experience.

  ### 2. Component Architecture: 
    The application was organized into modular components, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns. This approach facilitated easier debugging and future enhancements.

  ### 3. State Management with useState: 
    I employed the useState hook to manage the state of the quiz, including the current question, user-selected answer, and lifeline availability. This allowed for real-time updates and smooth progression through the game.

  ### 4. Conditional Rendering: 
    I implemented conditional rendering to dynamically display different components based on the game's state, such as showing the question, lifeline options, and the final result.

  ### 5. Timer Functionality: 
    To add a sense of urgency and mimic the show's format, I integrated a timer that counts down as the user answers each question. This feature further enhanced the excitement and challenge of the game.

  ### 6. Styling with CSS: 
    The application was styled using CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface. I focused on responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

## Achievements and Learnings:
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of React.js and its core concepts, including state management, component lifecycles, and conditional rendering. It also honed my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and front-end development best practices. Additionally, working on this project provided valuable experience in creating engaging user interfaces and incorporating interactive features.

## Future Enhancements:
In future iterations, I plan to implement additional lifelines, enhance the user interface with animations, and introduce a backend server to store user scores and track progress over multiple sessions.
